### Welcome to hmr-lab!

Welcome to `hmr-lab`, a research group at the Siebel School of Computation and Data Science, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Our group is led by Prof. [Julia Hockenmaier](https://juliahmr.cs.illinois.edu/), focusing on fundamental topics in natural language processing (NLP).

Our research centers on several key areas:

**Collaborative dialogue in embodied environments**

How do humans communicate to solve complex, real-world tasks together? We study the dynamics of collaborative dialogue and develop autonomous agents capable of participating in joint problem-solving.

**Interpretability of deep language models**

How do deep language models represent and process natural language? We investigate mechanistic interpretability to make the behavior of these models more understandable and transparent.

**Evaluation of long-form text**

How can we automatically assess the quality of long, complex texts generated by language models? We focus on understanding long-form text evaluation and developing reliable and interpretable methods.

> Dr. Julia Hockenmaier is a full professor in the Siebel School of Computation and Data Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Her main area of research is computational linguistics or natural language processing. Before coming to Illinois, she was a postdoc with Aravind Joshi at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, and also a frequent visitor to Ken Dill's research group at UCSF. Before that, she earned her PhD in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh with Mark Steedman.

We are part of the larger [UIUC NLP group](https://nlp.cs.illinois.edu/).
